Each step is tested alone without any other heavy-duty use of resources 
like network bandwidth or running another memory-intensive task at the 
same time.

Each step is typically tested with a smaller subregion (0109) and a 
larger subregion (0701) to provide a range of times you can expect.

-------------
NED2Subregion
-------------
Test params: those listed in test() for subregion 0109 (NED data on USB 
2.0 drive, NHD data on local drive)
Called from: Command line (64-bit)
Time: 21 seconds

Test params: using NHD0701 (large), NED data on USB 2.0 drive, NHD on 
local
Calling program: ArcCatalog (64-bit)
Time: 3 minutes 25 seconds

--------
PreHPCC
-------

Test params: those listed in PreHPCC.test()--subregion 0109, all local 
hard drive
Called from: Command line (64-bit)
Time: 5 minutes 22 seconds
Input size: 2.4 GB staged directory
Output size: 1.4GB mosaic, 1.5GB of HUC8 clip tifs

Test params: using NHD0701 (large), all on local hard drive
Called from: ArcCatalog (background processing)
Time: 23 minutes 30 seconds
Input size: 7.3 GB staged directory
Output size: 4.7GB mosaic, 5.7GB of HUC8 clip tifs

--------------
File transfer from local to HPCC using Globus
--------------
Test params: Subregion 0109 results, both mosaic and HUC8 tifs
Size: 2.9 GB
Time: 5 minutes

Test params: Subregion 0701 results, both mosaic and HUC8 tifs
Size: 10.3 GB
Time: 16 minutes

--------------
Fill (TauDEM, on HPCC)

Test params: Subregion 0109 HUC8 clips 
Called using: job queue, jobs are processed concurrently so for 
example the trials below took under 3 minutes altogether.
Time: min time 21s (160MB file), max time 2 minute 36 
seconds (560MB file)

Test params: Subregion 0701 HUC8 clips
Called using: job queue as before
Time: min time 1 minute 14 seconds (287MB file), max time 14 minutes 21 
seconds (530MB file)

------------
File transfer from HPCC to local using Globus
------------
If you transfer new "filled" files only (*fel*tif)
0109: 3 minutes
0701: 8 minutes


-------------
Create HU8 Walls
-------------
Test params: Those for subregion 0109 in HU8Walls.test(), all local 
drive
Time: 1 minute 10 seconds
Input size: 1.5GB directory
Output size: 2.1GB directory
