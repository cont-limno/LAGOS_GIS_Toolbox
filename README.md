LAGOS GIS Toolbox
===================

ArcGIS toolbox for landscape limnology.

This toolbox is for ArcGIS and was created with and for version 10.1. It will not work with any previous version of ArcGIS.
It might work for 10.2, but we are not sure yet.
It also requires Spatial Analyst for some tools and Rivex for an input (rivers with Strahler) to the Lake Order Tool.

While some steps in our workflow at Michigan State University are conducted in a supercomputing environment (ie Taudem
pitremove & d8flowdir were ported to RHEL to get the data processed faster), you can do these steps on a workstation
easily enough, with ESRI's tools or with Taudem toolbox or command line. Taudem tools are very helpful.

The toolbox is unsupported but feel free to direct questions to Patricia Soranno, soranno@msu.edu 

Enjoy.
